    description= _ "The mere Warlords seen in orcish raids upon the southlands had lead many to think the orcs were simple beasts, little better than wolves.  Little did those southerners realise, the dimwitted Warlords were just obedient lieutenants of the Northern Lords.  The Northern Lords do not have Sovereign lineage, they are of common stock.  However, many (if not all) of the Orcish Sovereign dynasties were founded by a Northern Lord of common stock; for all the shortcomings of the orcish society, it cannot be said that it is not a meritocracy."
    # Only orcs with both great cunning and unsurpassed strength can become Warlords. Masters of the sword, and even possessing some skill with the bow, these beast-warriors lead their brethren with iron will and iron hand."
