    description= _ "The orcs that most of the denizens of Wesnoth are familiar with are the teaming masses forced out of the Northlands.  But the orcish societies are more complicated in those Northlands.  Snow-Walkers might have their origins in a big-game hunting tactic, but now they are a class of warrior that is skilled at moving on the ice and snow.  They tend to be a bit sturdier than the more common warriors, and resistant to the cold of their customary environment."
