About
=====

**Archaic Resources** is an add-on for Battle for Wesnoth (BfW), providing original map terrain and some units useful in some other add-ons.  
It does not by itself provide playable content.  For the BfW project, visit:

License
-------

The add-on's source code, artwork, and sound assets are provided under
the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2, or (at your option) any
later version, under the same terms as the main BfW project.


Note: The artwork will most likely be released under CC-BY-SA, but I am reluctant to make the switch before the main BfW project does.


Installing
----------

This add-on is best installed through the BfW add-on interface.  Please see the BfW help for more information.
